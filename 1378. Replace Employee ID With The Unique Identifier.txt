# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT eu.unique_id ,		-- from EmployeeUNI
e.name	 			-- from Employees
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI eu
ON e.id = eu.id;		 -- join condition: match IDs

/* here used left join because 
we want all values from the employees table no matter whether they have got unique_id or not 
lets consider employees table on the left hand side and employeesUNI on right 
we want all name values so LEFT JOIN select all values from the left table 
and it will only select values that match the given condition from the employeesUNI.*/
