-- Select the 'name' column from the 'Customer' table
SELECT
    name
FROM
    Customer
WHERE
    -- We want to return customers who either:
    -- 1. Do not have a referee (referee_id is NULL)
    -- 2. Have a referee_id that is NOT equal to 2
    referee_id IS NULL OR referee_id != 2;

-- Important note:
-- Using 'referee_id != 2' **alone** will NOT include NULL values,
-- because comparisons with NULL return UNKNOWN in SQL.
-- So we must explicitly check for 'IS NULL' to include those records.
